An honest man has hardly need to count more than
his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add
his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity,
simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs
be as two or three, and not a  - hundred or a
thousand; instead of a million count half a
dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail.
